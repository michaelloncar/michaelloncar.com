Never had any spots to shove, not even blind shoves. Blinds went through me, shoved pre for 51K UTG +1 with Q-10, Blinds at 5K with a 500 ante. Button called, blinds fold. He flipped up 66. 114K pot. 6 on flop. He shipped the pot. One of the sickest tourney days ever for me. Lost all my small pots and never connected with flops and lost 4 out of 5 flips. Happy with how I played, I try and grind and only get flips when I have people covered and when I already have chips invested unless they're just super standard flips, all of which were today. On to the next one.
---
Second break. 69K. It's been a very frustrating day. Still alive, hoping for my turnaround after the break. Big blind is going to be 5K when we return.
---
Called 3 raises to 8K with the BB at 3K with KQ of diamonds, AJ off, and again KQ of di. Had to fold all 3 on the flop. It folded around to my high-jack with black 33, BB at 3K with a 300 ante. I started the hand with 41,500. I make the most standard shove ever pre-flop with my stack, button called, blinds folded. He flopped up AQ off. 3 on flop, won my 4th flip of the day, back up to 90K. Blinds just went up to 2K/4K with a 400 ante.
---
Very next hand, I raise to 6K, BB still 2,400, with A9 of clubs. Blinds both call, 3-way to the flop. Flop comes out 9-8-3 with 2 hearts. Great flop for me. Blinds both check. I bet 14,500. Small blind calls quickly. Big blind folds. Turn is a 2 of hearts, 3 hearts on turn. He checks, I check. River is the 5 of diamonds. He checks instantly. I feel like I'm good here, didn't think he'd check 67 super fast if he had it, so I put a 20K value bet in to get called by a weaker 9, any 8, maybe even a weaker pair. I have a very loose table image so I'm gonna get called really light here. He insta calls and flips up pocket 8s for a set. Haha. 55K now. What a day so far :P
---
Big blind at 2,400 with a 300 ante, player to my right limps, I make it 8K with KQ spades. Button goes all-in for 37K. Folds back around to me, I don't love it but I have to call for 29K more. I call and he tables 99. Board runs out 10-8-3-J-10. He wins the 80K flip. 0 for 3 on coin flips for the day for me, nothing I can do about that. 100K now.
---
First break, 132K
---
Blinds at 800/1,600 with a 200 ante, under the gun opened to 3,500, middle position shoved pre for 48,700. I look down at black 10-10. Normally I would lean towards folding here for a 30 BB shove but it was his 3rd over-shove pre in the last 2 rounds so I thought his range was wide enough to call. I called, everyone else folded. He flipped up ace queen of hearts for a 100K+ pot. Ace on flop, no ten.
---
Day 2 of the $500K today in Baltimore, big blind actually started at 1,200 today. Started the day with 269K. First level 1 opened to 3,200 with 22. Player to my left that had just lost a 120Kish pot with 97 vs AK on a A-8-4 flop by shoving on a bad read was obv semi tilted, he shoved for 19,600 pre. I called. He flipped up J9 of di. Jack on the flop. He won the 40K+pot.

March 12, 2015. 10 minutes before the start of the $7,500 WPT Shooting Star @ Bay 101. 36 players remaining, I started the day 15th in chips. I finished 21st place for $28,360 and also had a $2,500 Shooting Star Pro Bounty. Not the finish that I was hoping for but I played my best and things just didn't go my way on Day 3. Video was shot for my Facebook friends.

<img src="http://michaelloncar.com/images/3monitors.png" alt="Michael Loncar" height="42" width="42">
My name's Michael Loncar, and I'm a professional poker player. I've always loved the game. My dad got me into online poker for play money when I was 12 and my love for the game grew from there. I've always been into competitive games. I played basketball my entire life and I've always loved the psychological side of poker. Over the years I feel like that's become the strongest part of my game, being able to have the right mental mindset that you need to have in poker to be successful. It's REALLY important in poker AND in life to always be super positive. Always expecting and believing that things are going to go your way is a huge advantage. I've been playing for a living full time since 2007. I played 99% online from 2007-2011 and made the switch over to live cash games at the beginning of 2012. I've had a lot of success in the tourneys that I've played but have kept my focus on grinding cash games. I've been coaching a few players for most of 2017 and their progress has been VERY exciting to watch. I'm looking to take on a few more students that want to do a two hour session once a week. I'm also starting a group session that will take place once every two weeks at a discounted rate where everybody can interact and ask questions at the end of the session. I coach in both cash games and tournaments. Send an e-mail to PokerPro333@hotmail.com if you're interested!
